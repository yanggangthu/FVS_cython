# I)	THE METHOD
This repo contains functions used to calculate maximum feedback vertex set for directed graph.

This algorithm is a fast approximation based on simulating annealing(SA) of a noval local search of topological ordering.

The algorithm is describe in the paper "Galinier, P., Lemamou, E. & Bouzidi, M.W. J Heuristics (2013) 19: 797. doi:10.1007/s10732-013-9224-z". The code follows the pseudocode given in Page 805 in that paper.

The code is written in Cython and Python 2.7. The module requires NetworkX 1.11.

Another version written in Python is available at https://github.com/yanggangthu/FVS_python. 
The cython version is typically 5-10 times faster than the python version.


# II) STRUCTURE OF MODULE
Related functions are stored in FVS.py and FVS_localsearch_10_cython.pyx 

Core functions of finding maximum sub topological ordering of a given graphp is written in FVS_localsearch_10_cython.pyx. This part is written in Cython.

FVS.py is more like a python wrapper, that deals with input and calculate the minimumÂ  FVS by subtracting the nodes in the topological ordering from all the nodes.
One should can FVS() in FVS.py to calculate feedback vertex set.   

FVS_test.py contains three examples illustrating how to use the code.

# III)	INSTRUCTIONS  

To use this module, if .pyd file already exists, one can directly import FVS and call FVS() just as a regular python function.  

If .pyd file does not exist or the user wants to adapt the cython code (.pyx file), one needs to   
1. have cython installed
2. make sure the filename that you are trying to cythonize in the setup.py file is correct   
3. type "python setup.py build_ext --inplace" in the command prompt under the current folder   

The .c and .pyd file should exist now. Then one can import FVS and call FVS() just as a regular python function.   
There can be problems related to cython version and compiling environment, thus result is not guaranteed.
We would like to help and correspondence should be directed to gzy105@psu.edu   

The function can take 6 paramters listed below and the first is neccessary.  

Parameters
----------
G : NetworkX Graph/DiGraph, result for MultiGraph is not tested  
T_0 : the initial temperature  in SA  
alpha : the cooling multiplier for temperatue in the geometric cooling regime  
maxMvt_factor : maxMvt_factor times network size is the number of iterations for the inner loop given a fixed temperatue  
maxFail : FVS_local_search stops when maxFail number of outloops (temperatue) fail to improve the result  
randomseed: random seed for generating random numbers  

Default Parameter Value  
-----------------------
T_0 = 0.6, alpha = 0.99, maxMvt_factor = 5, maxFail = 50, randomseed=None  
The default values are suggested by the author of the paper.  
T_0 and maxFail are chosen after a limited number of preliminary experiments
alpha is chosen more arbitrarily, however alpha should be a positive number slightly small than 1.  
Increase alpha or maxMvt_factor or maxFail will increase the time of finding FVS.

Returns
-------
An approximation of the minimum FVS of the given graph as a list.

# IV) EXAMPLES
>>>import networkx as nx  
>>>import FVS  

Here we construct an example with an optimal solution. G2_FVS shoule be ['A'] as a list.  
>>>G2=nx.DiGraph()  
>>>G2.add_edges_from([('A','B'),('B','C'),('C','A'),('A','D'),('D','A')])  
>>>G2_FVS=FVS.FVS(G2)  

Here we construct an example of three-node feedback loops.   
We show how you change all the parameters and set a random seed.  
Your result should be the same with the same randomseed.  
>>>G3=nx.DiGraph()  
>>>G3.add_edges_from([('A','B'),('B','C'),('C','A')])   
>>>G3_FVS=FVS.FVS(G3, T_0=0.6, alpha=0.99, maxMvt_factor=5, maxFail=50, randomseed=1)
